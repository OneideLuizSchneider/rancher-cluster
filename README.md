# using-rancher-cli

**First step:** \
Make sure you have Docker installed.

**Second step:** We need to run the Rancher Server with some commands, ex.:
  
```
sudo docker run -d \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  --name rancher \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v /opt/rancher:/var/lib/rancher \
  rancher/rancher:latest --no-cacerts
```
The --no-cacerts will make sure https://rancher_url/v3/settings/cacerts is empty.
**Remember**, this is optional.
This solve the problem: **x509: certificate signed by unknown authority**

**Third step:**
  We need to use rancher-cli official image for run the commands(You can make for yourself an image).
```  
  1. rancher login HOST TOKEN
  2. rancher ps # for see the k8s deployments
  3. rancher kubectl set image deployments/nginx nginx=nginx:latest # for update a deployment
```  
 

Whith this we can use Rancher CLI commands, for example in Continuous Integration.

Enjoy it :D
